### ðŸ‘‹ About Me

I'm Prateek Shrivastava â€” a data science leader with 12+ years of experience applying AI and analytics to solve complex problems across supply chain, marketing, and enterprise systems.

I currently lead advanced analytics initiatives at Cummins, where I build predictive models and intelligent systems to drive operational impact and digital transformation. My previous roles at 84.51Â° (Kroger) and Vantiv have shaped a career grounded in measurable results and scalable solutions.

I grew up in a small town in central India â€” the kind of place where the monsoon carried memories more than material things. That curiosity led me to mathematics, a degree in computer engineering, and eventually a master's in Information Systems in the U.S.

Since then, Iâ€™ve worked across Fortune 500 companies, contributed to marketing, retail, and supply chain analytics, and spoken at INFORMS and other industry forums. My work has been featured on platforms like *InformationWeek*, *MarketingSherpa*, and podcasts like *The Intelligent Leader*.

Outside of work, Iâ€™m a FIRE (Financial Independence, Retire Early) enthusiast, a vegetarian, and someone who values kindness and curiosity. I'm also exploring writing through a Substack on technology, economics, and society.
